In this project I made a dynamic website using HTML, CSS, PHP and MYSQL. I implemented registration and login system, session storage, and ability to fetch all registered users and display them in table.

## Tools used

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, MYSQL, XAMPP and Visual Studio Code as an IDE

## Purpose of the project

Purpose for developing this project is getting familiar with making dynamic websites using PHP and MYSQL.

## How to run

1. Clone repository to your local machine
2. Copy user-registration folder from source folder into C:\xampp\htdocs\ folder
3. Open XAMPP and start apache and MySQL server
4. Open browser and navigate to: localhost/user-registration/index.php

## Note

I had to change MySQL port to 3307 instead of default 3306, as the default port was already in use for something else on my machine.
